        ### Welcome to the Cryosphere module
        Learn how we use satellite data to measure the icy parts of our planet.
        In this module you will learn about how we measure the cryosphere from space using satellites.
        You will learn about
        * Electromagnetic spectrum
        * RADAR
        * Reaction of the cryosphere to climate change
