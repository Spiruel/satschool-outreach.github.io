        ### Welcome to the Cryosphere module
        Learn how we use satellite data to measure the some of the most remote parts of our planet.
        In this module you will learn about how we measure the cryosphere from space using satellites.
        You will learn about
        * Electromagnetic spectrum
        * Different land ice forms
        * Why they are important to study

        ### [Cryosphere StoryMap Collection](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/48a40a6c28ff4996a42ee042d303012c)
        This collection contains an introductory StoryMap, this gives a short summary about the cryosphere.
        The student how sateliites help us to study these regions. 
        There are also two activity StoryMaps
        * The Arctic from Space
        * The Antarctic from Space
