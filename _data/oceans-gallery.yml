        ### Welcome to the Oceans module
        Learn how we use satellite data to measure the living parts of our planet.
        In this module you will learn about how we measure the biosphere from space using satellites.
        You will learn about
        * Electromagnetic spectrum
        * False colour composites
        * Forest fires
