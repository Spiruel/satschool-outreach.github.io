        ### Welcome to the Oceans module
        The oceans are the foundation of all life on Earth, and our planet ecosystems depends on the health of the oceans to support and sustain it. 
        The Ocean from Space StoryMap collection explores why the oceans are important and how Earth Observation is helping to increase monitoring efforts 
        at a global scale. This collection of StoryMaps is a cross-curricular dive into our oceans from space; exploring Geographical Information Systems (GIS), environmental/ocean geography, ocean biology and ocean physics. The collection is comprised of a 10 minute introduction, The Oceans from Space, along with one of three more in depth 40 minute StoryMaps.
